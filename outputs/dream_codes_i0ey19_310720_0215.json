I don't want you guys spending hours in my dream trying to find it... If you find 7 consider yourself victorious! This is just proof of concept for future possible puzzle style dream suite islands................ Does anyone want to play a game? On my Dream Island I have hidden 8 presents wrapped in yellow wrapping paper and a red bow. When you find them open them and drop them on one of the rocks in this location. When you have all 8 items dropped on the rocks, stand in the middle and take a picture and DM it to me. I will send the first 5 people that DM it to me a prize.....

Slightly south is a bamboo area where you can eat and fish.\n\nThe right side of the island is for the residents of the island. Each resident has their own personalized yard. Follow the middle path to get to the shops at the back of the island.\nA stage with a pteranodon is located next to the able sisters where you can sing and play instruments.\n\nThe bottom-right of the island you'll find a zodiac themed, beach-side restaurant with some friendly crab waiters to take your order. It features two complete plesiosaurs in front of a giant moon. This makes it the perfect spot to wish on some stars.\n\nThe beaches are pretty standard. There's a surf shop on the lower-left beach, a dedicated horseshoe crab beach on the left side as well. You can see some sea turtle nests on the center beach, and a fish shop on the right beach past the restaurant.\n\nThe upper-right beach is a recreation of salmon run from Splatoon 2! (I have uploaded the patterns so feel free to recreate this stressful Splatoon experience.)\n\nIguanafall is still a work-in-progress so any feedback is welcome!\nI hope you enjoy your stay!",
