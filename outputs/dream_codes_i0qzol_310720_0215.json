The island is divided into a series of districts:\n\nPark District- directly to the left of the airport. It features the player house, a fountain, Able Sisters, Nooks Cranny, a lilly garden and pool, and Sheldon\u2019s house.\n\nMuseum District- directly to the right of the airport. It contains the museum, the homes of Dizzy, Phoebe, Croque, and Pierce, \u00a0a small swimmers beach, and a tulip garden.\n\nOrange District- to the west of the Park District, across the river. Home to Vesta, Becky, and Victoria, it plays host to all the orange trees on the island. It also has a small windflower garden, a larger mum garden, a surf beach, and the lighthouse point.\n\nOrchard District- north of Resident Services, across the river. Home to Maddie and Lucha, it plays host to the large non-native fruit orchard, the campground, and a secret path to the private beach.\n\nBamboo Coast- to the east of the museum district. The eastern shore, it has the island pier, a large decorated bamboo grove, the Brass Key basketball court, and a fishing pond.\n\nMonument Grove- up the hill from the orange district, this enclosed space houses many stone sculptures, the future rock garden, and a secret path to the rear of the hill, leading to a small wild cosmos patch. The upper level contains a cedar forest, a wild hyacinth garden, picnic area, and Celeste\u2019s favorite spot for watching the stars.\n\nRose Hill Experimental Station- up the hill from the orchard, the entrance is on the northeast beach. The entire mountain is covered in roses, in an attempt to grow the elusive blue hybrid. The top of the hill also contains a large wind and solar power installation, and a prototype irrigation system, providing water to the orchard below.\n\nCome visit!

Villagers are located throughout, my favorites currently are Diana, Ankha, and Anchovy. Diana is my absolute favorite villager of all time. Her house is life goals.\n\nThere's mini-golf, a small pizza cafe, a tiny outdoor library, zen garden on a hill, chill beach hang zones, and a workout space for my jock villagers. Check out my house on the top far left corner of the beach (light blue house, pink door).\n\nQuick warning: If you're talking to Ankha it's NSFW or young children with her saying, everyone else is good to go for all ages. Hope you enjoy!!!\n\n**DA-0702-1545-1647**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://imgur.com/0ZCrFxo](https://imgur.com/0ZCrFxo)",

Come play on our diving board beach and waterfall jump path. You may even find a secret or two. We have three eateries including a courtyard cafe where you can type your next novel, a tiki bar beach, and a taco stand run by a mollusk. We also have temporary stands throughout; we intend to change with seasons. I can\u2019t wait to make a Halloween Bazar on the courtyard in October! \n\nI think we are at 4 stars due to our insistence to continue to drop stuff but you can\u2019t take away my kickass diy crafting yard. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI won\u2019t let you! I like to craft on cliffside views of the beach! The middle part is also heavily under construction. We started an attempt at a rock garden, but kids need to play has slowed us down. I\u2019m also considering moving Meme\u2019s (Grandma) house (yellow roof) to the beach somewhere and styling it like a beachside airbnb since she doesn\u2019t play very often. \n\nI welcome any feedback. We\u2019re still very much in working with what we have instead of what we want in the styling of the island. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nFair warning; we are going through a ramp relocation and today\u2019s the day we don\u2019t get to have a ramp so the island has a slight lack of flow of walk ability on the back without a ladder.\n\nFun fact: While there are 3 horses (technically one is a unicorn) on Horseland, we are not a horse specificity themed island. It\u2019s simply the name my daughter picked. \ud83d\ude42",

Honestly feels like a mess, especially since there\u2019s flowers everywhere, but I like the way it\u2019s turning out. Welcome and have fun! :)\n\nDA-7959-2868-8952",
