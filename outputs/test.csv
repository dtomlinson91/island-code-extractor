1596116255.0,"Looks really nice. I have tried a few times to make a site but I can never get the aesthetics right - I like clean and simple which is exactly what you have done. Nice work.

Only criticism (and this is only because I work as a software tester) is that you have a bug. When you click \`get started\` without logging in you get the message telling you you will be redirected to the login page - this didnt happen for me. Thought I'd mention it as you prob will want to fix it! Good luck with it!",GU10,https://reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/i0k9s8/i_made_my_first_website_using_python/fzq78tp/

Maybe would be cool but I will never know.

1596176293.0,"The site looks pretty slick, I like it. I took the test and scored very high in neuroticism, which is strange. I answered all the relevant questions negatively, as in I do not tend to get stressed or nervous:

I had test ID 231 if that helps. Maybe the wording of the questions made me answer oppositely?

> You become anxious often and easily. You are unhappy a lot and prone to negative emotions. You might even have experienced mental conditions like severe anxiety or depression sometime. You sometimes panic while handling difficult situations. While being high or low in others doesn't really mean all that much, scientists have found that being high in neuroticism generally means a difficult life. However, no personality is quite concrete and one can slide to being low in neuroticism anytime (and vice-versa).
