It's mainly forrest/cottage-like with sections of cafes and parks sprinkled about. I share with my husband and he owns the top left corner of the island if you're looking for something off-putting and a little creepy. Looking forward to (hopefully) more food items/themes to be added. Enjoy!!

I started my island late June. So in comparison to some, my island is a baby. 

I recently recieved 5 stars for my little place. So I must be getting something right :)

I'm aiming for Rivendell to be as natural as possible, with little areas for shopping (located near the entrance) etc.

My house is right at the top of the island. With a little garden. A small lake with a waterfall. And a place to sit and relax. There is even a cup of coffee/tea.

I do hope you enjoy your visit. The water is still warm. The picnic area is buzzing. And you can enjoy a visit to the park. Don't forget to say hi to the islanders.

DA-6685-8239-1724

Can anyone please check to see if items you pick up in dreams get cataloged? 

Outside of my Nook’s I’ve left: System kitchen in black, Deluxe Washer in red, Screen in bamboo pattern, Colorful Wheel in colorful numbers, Synthesizer in red and the Upright Piano in white. 

If you don’t have any one of these items cata’d, please pick them up, leave the dream when ready, and check your catalog to see if they have registered. 

Report in a comment your results please!",soundsynthesis,https://reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/i0ey19/megathread_new_horizons_dreamfriend_code_sharing/fzqnyfi/,DA-6685-8239-1724

Come dream on HoneyDew, my 5 star island. Explore the cafe & library, visit the orchard, and take a walk through the flower garden. Both homes are complete - make sure to stop in the basements :))

Snowy southern hemisphere island with the cute little fairy-tale vibe. The only thing cuter is my villagers.

It's 5 stars but I'm not really sure how, it's not fancy AT ALL. No theme, no custom-designed stuff (except for the flag, and that's ..... extremely basic lol).
